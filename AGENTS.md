# sluggrs

GPU-based vector text rendering using the Slug algorithm. Drop-in
replacement for cryoglyph in iced's wgpu text rendering pipeline. Evaluates
quadratic bezier curves per-pixel in fragment shaders -
resolution-independent, no texture atlas needed.

## Project structure

### Library (`src/`)
- `lib.rs` - Public API, re-exports, cosmic_text re-exports, GlyphInstance,
  shader constants
- `outline.rs` - Glyph outline extraction via `skrifa`, cubic->quadratic
  subdivision, COLR color emoji
- `prepare.rs` - GPU preparation: line segment perturbation, FAKE_ITALIC shear
- `prep.rs` - Mono glyph prep phase (`prepare_mono`), parallel-ready seam
  paired with `text_atlas::commit_mono`
- `band.rs` - Band acceleration structure (spatial index for shader curve lookup)
- `glyph_cache.rs` - GlyphKey, GlyphEntry, GlyphMap for resolution-independent caching
- `gpu_cache.rs` - Shared GPU state (shader, bind group layouts, pipeline cache)
- `text_atlas.rs` - Curve + band texture management, glyph upload, texture growth
- `text_renderer.rs` - prepare() + render() pipeline matching cryoglyph's interface
- `raster_text.rs` + `raster_text.wgsl` - Raster fallback for non-vector
  glyphs (absorbed from iced)
- `viewport.rs` - Screen resolution uniform buffer
- `types.rs` - Resolution, TextBounds, TextArea, ColorMode, error types
- `simple_shader.wgsl` - Simplified Slug shader (no dilation)
- `shader.wgsl` - Full Slug shader (with dilation, not yet wired up)

### Other
- `examples/demo.rs` - Standalone wgpu/winit demo
- `examples/demo2.rs` - Demo with viewport scroll + MSAA
- `examples/hotpath.rs` - Profiling binary for brokkr
- `examples/email_bench.rs`, `email2_bench.rs`, `gpu_bench.rs` - Benchmark
  targets (email-client scale, mixed-locale, GPU timing)
- `tests/` - Spike tests and unit tests (GPU-only tests are ignored by default)
- `docs/` - Design docs, investigation log, integration spec
- `repos/` - gitignored checkouts of iced, cosmic-text, cryoglyph for reference
- `research/` (gitignored) - reference repos and docs: Slug reference shaders,
  fontations, cosmic-text, vello, mesa, wgpu-naga, gpuweb spec, Vulkan spec,
  NVIDIA shader guides, JCGT paper, and other Slug implementations.

## brokkr

All builds, tests, and profiling go through `brokkr`, the shared dev tool.
Never raw `cargo` - no exceptions, including for quick iteration while
implementing and including the iced checkout. `brokkr check` is the
default: it covers clippy and the test suite in one command. Whether a
given session may run brokkr at all is stated per session; when in doubt,
don't - the orchestrator runs the checks.

If brokkr reports a lock (`already locked by PID`), another project is using it.
Wait and retry - the lock exists to prevent concurrent benchmark interference.

### Available in sluggrs
```sh
brokkr check                                  # clippy + tests
brokkr check -- --test glyph_pipeline_test    # run one test file
brokkr check -- -- --ignored                  # run ignored (GPU-only) tests
brokkr hotpath                                # timing profile (1 run, stored in results.db)
brokkr hotpath --hotpath 3                    # 3 timing runs (run count rides on the mode flag)
brokkr hotpath --alloc                        # allocation profile
brokkr hotpath --alloc 5                      # 5 alloc runs

brokkr hotpath --target email                 # email-client-scale benchmark (8k+ glyphs)
brokkr hotpath --target email2                # mixed-locale inbox (CJK/Arabic/Hindi, 200 messages)
brokkr hotpath --target email --alloc         # email benchmark with allocation tracking
brokkr hotpath -v                             # full build/bench/result output
brokkr visual [snapshot] [--all]              # run visual snapshot tests
brokkr fmt                                    # cargo fmt (args forwarded raw)
brokkr list                                   # list snapshots and approval state
brokkr approve <snapshot>                     # record current output as accepted baseline
brokkr report <run_id>                        # show detailed results for a past run
brokkr visual-status                          # dashboard: all snapshots vs approved baselines
brokkr results                                # last 20 results
brokkr results <uuid>                         # look up by UUID prefix
brokkr results --compare abc1 def2 --mode bench   # compare two commits side-by-side
brokkr results --commit abc1                  # filter by commit prefix
brokkr env                                    # show environment info
brokkr clean                                  # clean build artifacts and scratch data
brokkr history                                # browse command history
```

The `--target` flag is a free-form string. `brokkr hotpath --target foo` builds
`examples/foo_bench.rs` and files results under the command name "foo" (the
default `hotpath` target files under "render"). The measurement mode is a
separate axis: exact values `bench`, `hotpath`, `alloc`. To add a new
benchmark target, create `examples/{name}_bench.rs` and a `[[example]]` entry
in `Cargo.toml`.

### Verifying changes that can alter rendered output

A plain `brokkr check` is not enough. Also run `brokkr visual --all` against the
approved baselines, and the GPU-gated test suite (`brokkr check -- -- --ignored`).
The ignored suite is not part of a plain `brokkr check`, and it holds tests a
snapshot cannot catch - e.g. `tests/solver_regression_test.rs`, which pins the
solver cancellation fix at an exact subpixel witness no snapshot scene hits.
For performance work, profile with `brokkr hotpath` and commit
`.brokkr/results.db` alongside the code.

## Lints

Cargo.toml has 27 clippy deny-level rules covering style, error handling,
async safety, and no-debug-code. Performance-constraining lints (`cast_*`,
`float_cmp`, `indexing_slicing`) are intentionally excluded - speed at all
costs.

## Tech stack

- Rust (edition 2024, MSRV per `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`)
- cosmic-text (shaping, layout, font system) - the same git rev as iced, see below
- skrifa 0.40 (glyph outline extraction)
- wgpu 29 (GPU textures, render pipeline)
- hotpath 0.28 (function-level profiling, brokkr integration)
- WGSL shaders (translated from Slug HLSL reference, MIT licensed)

### Deliberate version pins

`ccu` will report skrifa and wgpu as outdated. Both are pinned on purpose,
and cosmic-text is a git dependency on purpose:

- **cosmic-text must be the exact crate iced uses.** cosmic-text types
  (`Buffer`, `FontSystem`) cross the sluggrs/iced API boundary, so both must
  resolve to one crate. Upstream iced depends on an experimental fork
  (`hecrj/cosmic-text`, pinned by git rev) whose APIs iced's own code uses,
  so sluggrs pins the same rev - cryoglyph does the same. A
  `[patch.crates-io]` in iced would not work: patches only apply in the root
  workspace, so downstream apps would still get two cosmic-texts. Whenever
  an iced catch-up bumps the rev, bump it here too.
- **skrifa tracks cosmic-text, not latest.** Our skrifa pin matches the
  version cosmic-text depends on directly, so the two dedup; swash pulls in
  a newer skrifa of its own. Bumping ours to latest would put yet another
  skrifa in every downstream build for no gain, since skrifa is internal to
  sluggrs (not re-exported, no types cross the iced boundary). Bump only
  when cosmic-text does.
- **wgpu must match iced.** wgpu types (`Device`, `RenderPass`,
  `TextureFormat`) cross the sluggrs/iced API boundary, so wgpu 30 has to
  wait for upstream iced.

hotpath has no downstream coupling and can be bumped freely.

## Rules

### General rules

- Don't use gremlins! Em-dash, en-dash, strange quotes, whatever - they're all verboten.
- Don't remind the user of the rules. They wrote them, so they know them.
- The user can exempt you from any rule at any time.

### Bash rules

- Never read or write from `/tmp`. All data lives in the project.
- Never run raw `cargo`, `curl`, `pkill`. Use `brokkr`.

## Document folders

The standing layout, across every project. Three live folders plus one retired,
split by durability first, subject second.

| Folder | Contents | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `reference/` | Durable in-repo reference for anyone working on or with the code - how the thing is built and why: `architecture.md`, `technical-implementation-spec.md`, `performance.md` (the durable record of measured numbers over time), invariants, protocol contracts | Citable from source as a source of truth. What it says must be true. |
| `docs/` | Durable in-repo documentation of how the thing is used - guides, CLI reference, the consumer-facing API surface. Sometimes exposed as a hand-edited VitePress gh-pages site | Same must-be-true rule. |
| `notes/` | Transient - work items (`todo.md`), future plans, hypotheticals, bug reports, research, analysis. Things that will die | No truth guarantee. Nothing durable cites it. |
| `plans/` | Retired | Plan documents are transient: they go in `notes/`. |

`reference/` and `docs/` are both durable and both binding. The difference is
subject, not audience: `reference/` covers how the thing is built and why - what
you need in order to change it safely - while `docs/` covers how it is used. A
developer or library consumer reads both. Where a project publishes a site,
`docs/` is what gets published; the folder means the same thing either way.
`notes/` is neither durable nor binding, which is the whole point of keeping it
separate: a document that may be wrong must not sit where a document that must
be right is expected.

The dependency direction is therefore one-way. `notes/` may cite `docs/` and
`reference/`; nothing durable may cite `notes/` - not a code comment, not
`docs/`, not `reference/`. A code comment must carry its full context, because
it outlives the note.

**Root-level convention files are exempt.** `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
`README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md` and their kin are found by tooling and by
convention at the repository root, and stay there. These folders govern
documents we chose where to put, not files whose location is dictated.

In `notes/`, `docs/` and `reference/` alike, avoid citing source line numbers -
they drift fast.
